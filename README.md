Welcome to Compyled! This is a project that I have been seeing, so, I made my own compiler!

1. How to use:
2. Step 1: Create a new file
3.
4. Step 2: Import STARTER using: import STARTER

5. Step 3: Create a string full of you code. (Can be ' ', " ", or """"" """"")

6. Step 4: Type in your code, then compile it!

7. DISCLAMER: This is supposed to be a fun project, and it was! It does compile your python code I guess; although not that good. And it uses python to compile it. It doesn't make sense. (it uses python's interpeter to compile it) So its not that good.
